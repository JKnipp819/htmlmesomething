      <p>It started with a landmark deal when Disney annouced they had purchased Star Wars from George Lucas for whopping 4 BILLION DOLLARS.</p>

   <p>But Disney wasn't done...then they went after Marvel.  The House of Mouse now owns The House of Ideas.</p>

   <p>Where will it end???  At this point, the House of Mouse is little more than the overlord of entertainment via Star Trek's the Borg.  Their mission - simple..their mission - the same:  We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.</p>
