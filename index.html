      <p>It started with a landmark deal when Disney annouced they had purchased Star Wars from George Lucas for whopping <b>4 BILLION DOLLARS.</b></p>

   <p>But Disney wasn't done...then they went after Marvel.  The House of Mouse&reg; now owns The House of Ideas&copy;.</p>

   <p>Where will it end???  At this point, the House of Mouse is little more than the overlord of entertainment via Star Trek's the Borg.  Their mission - simple..their mission - the same:  We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQE66WA2s-A">Resistance is futile.</a></p>
